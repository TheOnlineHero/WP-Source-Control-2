4) Activate the plugin.




After you have installed the plugin, click on WP Source Control menu link and you will see a list of theme files that have not yet been commit. Select the ones that you wish to commit and enter a job no with description. The job no is your reference, it can be anything that you want, but create a job no that you can remember so that when you need to review this commit you can find it again.



There is a Search Commit form at the bottom of this page, if you search by job no, you will find all the commits associated with the commit. You can view the files at the time of the commit and you can see the changes made as part of this commit by clicking on Diff.
